    """
    Function for unwrapping the phase of a 2D image, given a reference seed as location and branch cuts defining walls
    the unwrapping is not allowed to cross.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phase : array_like
        2-d float array with wrapped phase values
    seed : tuple
        (row,column) starting point from which phase is unwrapped from
    branchCuts : array_like, optional
        2-d boolean array where True represents the location of the branch cuts which will be avoided
    mode: string, optional
        dfs or bfs; unwrapping method for which priority order unwrapping should occur in. 
            dfs is depth-first search and unwraps most resent entry in list (stack).
            bfs is breath-first search and unwraps oldest entry in list (queue).
    unwrapBranchPixels: bool, optional
        Notes whether branchcut pixels should be unwrapped or not. Default is true.

    Returns
    -------
    array_like
        2-d float array with the unwrapped phase. Branch cuts and unwrapped zones blocked by cuts have been
        removed. Seed location is set to phase=0.
